In this coding assignment I will be making a magic 8 ball.




Functions: 
* create_responses_file
* read_responses 
* magic_8_ball




Variables:
        
* Response
* Responses
* Question
* Answer


1. Create the file that contains all the possible answers. (8ball_responses.txt) 
2. I import random that way the choices are random when the user asks a question and receives different answers for different questions.
3. Create a function that interacts with the user. Whether he wants to ask a yes or no question or to quit the program.
4. Use a while true loop to make sure the user would like to continue and if not the program stops.
5. Call the main function to run the program.
