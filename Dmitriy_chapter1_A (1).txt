                In this coding project I am coding a program that is selling a limited amount of cinema tickets.


Functions: 
* selling_tickets




Variables:
* total_tickets
* total_buyers
* tickets_requested




1. First I define a function named “selling_tickets” .
2. I make sure to set the number of buyers to zero so the program can accurately calculate the number of people buying.
3. I set the number of tickets to 20 so there is a limit to how much tickets there are.
4. I use a “try” block to make sure there are no errors if the user types a non integer.
5. Then I use if else statements to make sure certain conditions are met.
6. Then I call the main function to run the program.
