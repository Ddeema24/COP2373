Functions:
__init__, __add__, __sub__, __mul__, __repr__, deposit, withdraw, test_bank_acct_operations.


Variables:
amount, currency, balance, acct.


1.Recall the money class I used in chapter 10 a exercise assignment.
2. Then I made a new class called BankAcct Class.
3. First function initializes the BankAcct object with an initial balance and currency.
4. Then I used a deposit function which deposits a specified amount into the account balance.
5. As well as a withdraw function which withdraws a specified amount from the account balance.
6. Make a test function to test the functions and make sure each individual function operates correctly using try and except blocks. 
7. Then I called the main function to run the program.
