        In this coding project I will code a program that can validate whether the phone number, ssn, or zip code is valid.


Functions: 
* validate_phone_number(phone_number)
* validate_ssn(ssn)
* validate_zip_code(zip_code)
* main()


Variables:
* phone_number
* pattern
* ssn
* zip_code




1. First I imported re in order to use the regular expressions.
2. Then I created 3 validate functions to actually validate whether the phone number, social security number, and zip code are valid or not. 
3. After validating those numbers we call a main function which actually asks the user for input and displays the results.
4. First it asks for the phone number and checks the condition with the if statement of whether or not its a phone number or not. (Returns a true or false statement essentially.)
5. Then it does the same thing for a social security number and the zip code number.
6. Call the main function to run the program.
