In this coding assignment I will be making a program that calculates the type of expense you did and the most you spent on an item as well as the total of all the items or expenses you did.


Functions:
* get_expenses
* calculate_total
* find_highest
* find_lowest
* total_expense
* highest_expense
* lowest_expense
* main
Valiables:
* expense_type
* amount
* expenses
* acc short for accumulator
* total_expense
* highest
* highest_expense
* lowest
* lowest_expense


1.First I imported “reduce” from functools to calculate the lists written later in the code.
2. Then I make a function that collects expenses from the user until he types done to finish the calculations,
3. Then I wrote 3 separate functions which calculate Highest expense, Lowest expense and the total of all the expenses.
4. Then I call main to start the program which starts running the program.
