In this coding project I made a program that scans an email message to see the possibility of it being a spam email or not. 

Functions: get_spam_score, rate_spam_likelihood, main


Variables: spam_keywords, score, found_keywords, message_lower, keyword, message, spam_score, spam_likelihood, 


1. Create a list with all the most common spam phrases.
2. Create a  function that checks how many spam keywords appear in the given email message.
3. Create a function that determines the likelihood that the message is spam based on the spam score.
4. Then the main function accepts the user input which allows the user to enter the email message. 
5. Call the main function.
