In this coding project I am writing a code that creates a csv file then prints it in read mode for viewing.


Functions: input(prompt), int(), open(filename, mode, newline=''), csv.writer(file), writer.writerow(row), open(filename, mode), csv.reader(file), next(iterator), print().


Variables: num_students, file, writer, first_name, last_name, exam1, exam2, exam3, reader, header, row.




1. Import the csv module
2. Prompt the user to enter how many students they want to input data for
3. Use the open() function to create or overwrite a file named grades.csv
4. Create a writer object that will allow you to write rows to the CSV file.
5. Loop to get student details




Second program:


1. Import the csv module.
2. Open the CSV file in read mode
3. Use csv.reader() to create a reader object that will allow you to read rows from the CSV file.
4. Use the next() function to read and store the header row from the CSV file.
5. Print the header row in a tabular format using formatted strings.
6. Loop through and read each row from the CSV file
7. Print a completion message.
