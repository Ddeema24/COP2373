Functions: 
__init__, __add__, __sub__, __mul__, __repr__, test_money_operations.
Variables:
amount, currency, m1, m2, m3, result.


1. First I used the init method which initializes a Money object with an amount and a currency.
2. Then I used the add method which allows for the addition of two Money objects using the + operator.
3. Then I do the same thing for sub and mul functions.
4. The repr method provides a string representation of the Money object.
5. Then I create a test function which has a try and except block for each function to test the code and show that it works. 
6. Call the main function to run the code.
